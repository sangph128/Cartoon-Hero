			<h2>About Toothless</h2>
			<p>Toothless is Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III's Night Fury and the deuteragonist in the <a href="https://www.howtotrainyourdragon.com/" target="_" title="The movie's website">"How To Train Your Dragon" </a> franchise.
			Having initially been shot down by Hiccup during a dragon raid during the events of How to Train Your Dragon, Toothless was nursed back to flying condition and became the Viking's best friend through their interactions and adventures. Following How to Train Your Dragon 2, Toothless is now a Titan Wing Night Fury as well as the new Alpha Dragon.</p>
			<h2>Toothless characteristics:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Toothless is the most intelligent of all the dragons and seems to have a dry sense of humor, similar to Hiccup's. When Hiccup released him, he did not kill Hiccup. From here it was a little bit evident that he sensed goodness in Hiccup. He just had a few doubts due to which he did not let Hiccup near him for a few days.</li>
				<li>He doesn't take kindly to being offended, nor anyone offending or endangering his human friend but is usually playful and even a little teasing when not threatened. He shows a sense of great curiosity, imitating Hiccup's actions and mannerisms when they initially encounter one another and can understand Hiccup's words and commands as well as agree with some of what he says. It is shown that he has become aware of Hiccup's relationship with Astrid, even seeming to briefly tease him about it, even though he did somewhat create it with the Romantic Flight scene in How to Train Your Dragon, which Toothless did to get Hiccup and Astrid together.</li>
				<li>Overall, the biggest attributes of Toothless' personality come through in his relationship with Hiccup. Equally protective and loyal, he never hesitates to risk his own life when Hiccup is put in danger and is more than affectionate when the time calls for it. His sense of devotion also shows itself when protecting Hiccup's allies and other friends. Toothless has shown to have a bit more of Hiccup's personality when battling Sleuther, seeing the fear in the other dragon's eyes, as it reminded him of when he had his first encounter with Hiccup.
					
				Toothless, although he cannot speak, shows a lot of emotions through his facial expressions and body language. Toothless has even been shown to make a laughing sort of noise and often gives a few critical looks if he doesn't like the looks of something.  </li>
